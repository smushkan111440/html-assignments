  <h1><center>College Life</center></h1>
<span><p style="font-size:120%;"> College life is considered a bridge in our lives between our school days and our career. It prepares us with the finest academics and platform to generate dreams into realities. It acts as a transition to prepare us to be more independent. In school, we were dependent on our parents.
Compared to school life, it is completely different. We are exposed to new experiences and ideas during our time in college. Our schools were a secure environment where we had spent the majority of our time growing up. The move to college is so abrupt that you are no longer shielded by your teachers and schoolmates.
In conclusion, college life is a multifaceted journey that encompasses academic pursuits, personal development, social interactions, and the exploration of passions. It's a phase where individuals transition from adolescence to adulthood, equipped with knowledge, skills, and experiences that shape their future.
