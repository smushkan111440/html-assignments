    <p>My Hobby Paragraph 150 words
I love to read. Reading is my hobby. I read books belonging to all genres. But it is adventure and mystery stories that keep me the most engaged. I enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. They are fascinating stories that keep me very captivated. I can read them over and over again and I enjoy them. I also love to read the Harry Potter series of books by J.K Rowling. She has woven so much magic through her stories. I also liked reading books by Enid Blyton.
I am now starting to read Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. It will be very fascinating to read the high-fantasy book. I always write a review to a book once I finish reading it. It is an interesting exercise to do. It helps me to briefly write about what I liked and enjoyed or disliked about the book.</p>

<p>My Hobby Paragraph 200 words
I find embroidery making very interesting. It is my hobby. I spend some time on it every day. It is very refreshing and relaxing for me to engage in my hobby.
I play with designs and colours. I can use different types of cloth to make embroidery on. I can choose many different colours of thread to make embroidery with. The patters I choose are also varied. I have made embroidered apparel and have always been excited to make a new item. Embroidery making is however time-consuming.
I have made many interesting items of embroidery. I have made a chocolate cake embroidery on a table cloth. It looks like a real birthday cake. I also embroidered sparrows on a stole. I love the sparrow but do not see it now-a-days on my verandah. My friends like my stole because they too miss the sparrow.
I am very fond of making embroidery on my motherâ€™s sarees. My mother buys sarees on which I embroider small flowers, leaves and butterflies. My mother loves to drape these sarees. Embroidery can make designs alive in a very beautiful and colourful way. A plain apparel can become a fashion garment if it is embroidered tastefully.</p>

<p>My Hobby Essay 250 Words
I enjoy going to the forests. It is my hobby that I find very exciting. Traveling in forests leaves me refreshed and energized. I find myself close to nature in forest areas. I always like to be part of a nature group to go to a forest. I learn about the trees and animals from nature experts in such groups.
I enjoy walking through the trees and grasses and foliage. Walking through an untidy forest or grassland on the rough paths in it is like an adventure story unraveling before me. The air in forests is very fresh. It is not like cities where there is so much vehicular pollution that affects our health adversely.
I began going to the woods with my father as a child along with my sister and uncles and cousins. My interest in going to the jungles has grown over the years. I find going to such places very rewarding. I can see different kinds of trees, plants, flowers and fruits.
I can watch many different birds and hear their sweet songs and unique calls. I can see many beautiful and colourful butterflies. I also learn about many interesting natural phenomena of the jungle. I can watch the kingfisher catching a fish and eating it. I can watch a weaver bird get into its nest or a munia build its nest. I can watch from close quarters the wild creatures that I can never see in a town or city where there is human habitation.

<p>Hobby Paragraph 300 words
I like making paintings with water colours as also oil colours. Paintings made with oil colours take time to make and get ready as the oils are slow in drying up. There is however a certain richness of colour in an oil painting. Water colours are quick to dry. I find the effect of water colours very soothing.
Abstracts are my favourite themes for painting. But there is meaning in the abstracts I make. They are not just a splash of colour. The abstracts I make are meaningful. I love to share the representations of my abstracts with those who ask to know it. When the meanings of abstracts are seen the paintings can be appreciated. Often the meanings of abstracts are not easy to decipher. But the coming together of colour and form in a painting is in itself beautiful.
I also like making portraits. I like to sit before a person and make their portrait. But this may not be possible always. I sketch portraits in black pen or in pencil. Portraits are interesting to make. I have made portraits of some celebrities and have had the opportunity to go and meet with them and have the portraits autographed by them. On a couple of occasions celebrities have wanted to have the picture with my signature. Such occasions humbled me.
Sometimes I make caricatures too. These are fun to make. They add a dash of humour to the portrait of a person. Subjects of my caricature drawings have never been offended by my work. They have liked my work and have praised it.
I find making drawings and paintings very rejuvenating. When I am lonely and bored my canvas and paper, tubes and bottles of colour and brushes give me wonderful company in a beautiful and colourful way.
