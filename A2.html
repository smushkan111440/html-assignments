<p style="font-size:120%;">Who created ShinChan show
Shin Chan is perhaps the most loved new age cartoon character and a definite phenomenon in the world of anime.
 A Japanese series written and illustrated by manga artist Yoshito Usui, Shin Chan made its first appearance in a 
 Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which is published by Futabasha.<strong>Real Story</strong>
 Apparently,Shinnosuke Nohara is the young boy on whom the character of a 5 year old Shin Chan is based. Nohara died in a
  car accident while trying to save his younger sister. After his death, the mother Misae experienced a period of deep
 misery and she started sketching her lost son.A young Nohara and his mischiefs returned as flashes of memory as a 
 mourning mother crayoned her dead child into sketches. Later, when Usai gazed at those beautiful paintings, he was 
 struck by the intensity of the despair and hope these sketches simultaneously reflected. As a real boy returned as a 
 manga character through some crayoned images,the world immediately caught on to Shin chanâ€™s real story that what soon 
 grew to be a phenomenon.<strong>  When was ShinChan Started</strong>In 1990, Shin Chan debuted in the world of manga
 courtesy Usui.The manga in its original form however had to end on September 11, 2009. The cartoon character returned as
a new manga in the summer of 2010 by the name New Crayon Shin-chan.ShinChan first aired in Japan on April 13, 1992.
